# Azure Website using Flask

This is a website I designed with Flask that follows the Microsoft Azure Quickstart guide.

This project was originally based on the sample Flask application for the Azure Quickstart [Deploy a Python (Django or Flask) web app to Azure App Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/quickstart-python).
